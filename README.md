# CognitiveFlexibility-MemoryAnalysis

R markdown used for the data analysis of the Master 2 memory and internship

Main_standard.Rmd is the main file where all the analysis are executed. If your goal is to review or use the script, i recommand you to download the html_standard file to get a nice output of that code. 
If your goal is the review the work from my internship memory, i suggest you also download the dashboard html output. 
To use HTML file, you just need to download them and execute them on any browser (chrome, firefox, edge..)
